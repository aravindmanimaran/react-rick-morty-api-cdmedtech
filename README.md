# Medicilio Frontend Challenge


Using the Rick & Morty API (rickandmortyapi.com) write a web app that

* displays characters (either with pagination or infinite scroll, it's up to you).
* by clicking on a character, shows its profile details.
* gives you the possibility of adding/removing a character to/from a list of `preferred characters`.
* shows the list of `preferred characters`(anywhere and in the style you want).

The profile of a character should include:
* Image.
* Character information (name and species).
* Origin and location information (name, dimension, amount of residents).
* Name of the chapters the character is featured on.

The API provides REST and GraphQL versions, pick your preferred one.  
You are free to use any library/framework: be ready to explain the rationale behind your choices.

The exercise should be submitted in a zip file without node_modules.  
Make sure that running your solution requires no global dependencies (besides node/npm/yarn) and it's possible to run it with only one command (besides yarn/npm install).

**Choose AT LEAST one of those and apply*:
* Use of Typescript
* Use of Redux (and Redux Saga) or React Context API
* Use of React Hooks
