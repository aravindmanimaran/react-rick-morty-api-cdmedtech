TODO:

Homepage \

1. Page details \
2. Make it responsive \
3. Way to easily see the preferred characters (Either Header/Different layout design) \

Character Details Page \

1. Instead of episode ID, call episode API to get the episode details \
2. Make it responsive \
3. Currently Back button is provided to view the characters, need to figure out a way to access pharacters/preferred characters (Using Headers) \
4. From character details page always the user is redirected to characters page 1, need to take the user back to already visited character page \

Notification \

- Character already added to preferred \
- When removing character from preferred \
- API error \

Figure out a way to aviod multiple API calls \
